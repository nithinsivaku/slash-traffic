 * This is projects web server app. 
 * It spins up an HTTP server using Express that can be called by the Slack server. 
 * It servers as an entry point for the whole app, but the file itself will deal only with 
 * the HTTP nuances of the app (routing, request parsing, response formatting, etc.) while 
 * the actual business logic will be spread in the other files.
